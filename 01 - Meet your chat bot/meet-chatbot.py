# Objective
# For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the year it was created. First impressions count!
# Your program should print the following lines:

# Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
# I was created in {birth_year}.

# Instead of {bot_name}, print any name you choose and replace {birth_year} with the current year (four digits). You don't need to take any input at this stage.

print("""Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.""")
