# Objective
# In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.
# Your program should print the following lines:

# Hello! My name is Aid.
# I was created in 2023.
# Please, remind me your name.
# What a great name you have, {your_name}!

# You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.
# Instead of {your_name}, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

print('Hello! My name is Aid.')
print('I was created in 2020.')
print('Please, remind me your name.')

your_name = input()

print(f'What a great name you have, {your_name}!')
